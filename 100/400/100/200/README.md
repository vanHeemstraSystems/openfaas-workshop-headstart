# 200 - Setup a Kubernetes cluster

You can follow the labs whilst using Kubernetes, but you may need to make some small changes along the way. The service address for the gateway changes from ```http://gateway:8080``` to ```http://gateway.openfaas:8080```. As far as possible these differences have been documented and alternatives are provided in each lab.
