# 400 - Kubernetes

## 100 - Setup a single-node cluster with Kubernetes

The labs use Kubernetes, Swarm is no longer supported by the OpenFaaS community. Some of the workshop labs will work for faasd, but you may need to alter the commands and we do not provide support for the workshop when taken with faasd.

See [README.md](./100/README.md)
